About the Dataset

The "Letter Recognition" dataset available on Kaggle is a machine learning dataset that contains features extracted from images of uppercase letters in the English alphabet.

The dataset consists of 20,000 samples, with each sample representing an image of one of the 26 uppercase letters A-Z. Each sample has 16 features, which are all integer values between 0 and 15, representing the number of on pixels in a 4x4 grid of pixels that make up the image.

The dataset is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for classification tasks and is often used to compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms on image recognition tasks.
